## Technology Stack & Framework Choices

### Core Technologies

#### **Backend Framework: FastAPI**
- **Choice Rationale**: FastAPI was selected for its:
  - Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation
  - Built-in request/response validation with Pydantic
  - Type hints integration for better developer experience

#### **Database: SQLAlchemy + Alembic**
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 for database operations
- **Migrations**: Alembic for schema versioning and migrations
- **Storage**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL-ready for production
- **Choice Rationale**:
  - Simplicity and locally defined database file

#### **Data Processing: Pandas + NumPy**
- **Pandas**: For cohort analysis and cashflow calculations
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **NumPy-Financial**: For IRR (Internal Rate of Return) calculations
- **Choice Rationale**: 
  - Pandas is good at time-series and cohort analysis
  - Still chose to primarily define my own data models using Pydantic rather than computing everything in Pandas. The reason for this is that conditional calculations like when to apply cash caps and when to apply thresholds is made much more complicated by Pandas. Given that Python runs fairly fast and we aren't yet dealing with massive scale of data that minor optimizations make a substantial difference, we should go with the simplest approach.

#### **Validation & Serialization: Pydantic**
- **Models**: Type-safe request/response schemas
- **Validation**: Automatic input validation
- **Serialization**: JSON serialization with type conversion
- **Choice Rationale**:
  - Tight integration with FastAPI, compile-time type checking
  - Admittedly, Pydantic has done a wonderful job building out an intuitive data modeling class. Having used dataclasses, protobufs, and other ways of setting up underlying data models, this one was quite seamless.

#### **Logging: Structlog**
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs for better observability. Allows segmentation of logs by file or purpose.
- **Context Preservation**: Request tracing and debugging capabilities. Can easily add custom fields to the logger to make sure it provides a high level of information possible.

#### **Testing: Pytest**
- **Framework**: Pytest for unit and integration testing
- **API Testing**: Direct HTTP calls for endpoint validation
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for calculations and API endpoints

### Development Tools

#### **Code Quality**
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter. Very lightweight and clean.
- **Type Hints**: Full type annotation coverage
- **Pre-commit**: Code quality enforcement

#### **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- **FastMCP**: Integration for AI assistant tool access
- **Purpose**: Enables AI assistants to interact with the API programmatically
- **Choice Rationale**:
  - I was interested in trying to make this work but ran out of time.
  - FastMCP has a package that allows you to bolt on an MCP server to an existing FastAPI server.
  - I got stuck with trying to get streaming to work properly with my chatbot approach and hooking this up to a LLM.
  - This is something that could be super interesting down the line, if you're able to wall off the data that a user has access to based on their permissioning.

## API Design

### Architecture Pattern: RESTful API with Resource Nesting

#### **Core Design Principles**

1. **Resource-Oriented Design**
   - Companies as primary resources
   - Nested resources under companies (trades, payments, spends, thresholds)
   - Clear hierarchical relationships

2. **Company-Scoped Endpoints**
   ```
   /companies/{company_id}/payments/
   /companies/{company_id}/trades/
   /companies/{company_id}/spends/
   /companies/{company_id}/thresholds/
   /companies/{company_id}/cashflows/
   ```

3. **Consistent HTTP Methods**
   - `GET`: Retrieve resources
   - `POST`: Create new resources
   - `PUT`: Update existing resources
   - `DELETE`: Remove resources

#### **Key Endpoint Categories**

##### **Company Management**
```http
GET    /companies/              # List all companies
POST   /companies/              # Create company
GET    /companies/{id}          # Get company details
```

##### **Financial Data Management**

```http
# Trades (Investment Terms)
POST   /companies/{id}/trades/           # Create trade terms
GET    /companies/{id}/trades/           # List company trades

# Payments (Customer Revenue)
POST   /companies/{id}/payments/upload   # Bulk upload via CSV
GET    /companies/{id}/payments/         # List payments
PUT    /companies/{id}/payments/{pid}    # Update payment
DELETE /companies/{id}/payments/{pid}    # Delete payment

# Spends (Marketing Investment)
POST   /companies/{id}/spends/           # Create spend record
GET    /companies/{id}/spends/           # List spends
PUT    /companies/{id}/spends/{sid}      # Update spend

# Thresholds (Performance Benchmarks)
POST   /companies/{id}/thresholds/       # Create threshold
GET    /companies/{id}/thresholds/       # List thresholds
PUT    /companies/{id}/thresholds/{tid}  # Update threshold
```

##### **Analytics & Reporting**
```http
GET    /companies/{id}/cashflows         # Current cashflow projections
POST   /companies/{id}/cashflows/predicted  # Predicted cashflows with churn
GET    /companies/{id}/cohorts_table     # Cohort analysis matrix
```

#### **CSV Upload Support**
- Bulk payment upload via `/companies/{id}/payments/upload` # this wasn't implemented yet but should be implemented
- Note that I did not yet implement this, but this would simply be able to ingest a monthly payment CSV and ingest it into the system. Handling data cleaning and validation is a gnarly problem in its own right, and we would need a way of notifying ourselves and users if we encounter an issue here.

## Database Design

### Schema Overview

The database follows a normalized relational design with clear entity relationships:

```sql
Companies (1) -> (N) Trades
Companies (1) -> (N) Payments
Companies (1) -> (N) Spends
Companies (1) -> (N) Thresholds
Spends (1) -> (N) Customers
```
- Customers is not necessary in this design given what we're showing in the UI at the moment
- We can add a dashboard for top performing customers which would make this really valuable for our portcos. But, at that point, we might be slightly overstepping into other tools that they have that give them context on sales and GTM.

### Core Tables

#### **Companies Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- **Purpose**: Portfolio companies managed by the CVF
- **Key Constraints**: Unique company names

#### **Trades Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE trades (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cohort_month DATE NOT NULL,
    sharing_percentage NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.5,
    cash_cap NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(company_id, cohort_month)
);
```
- **Purpose**: Investment terms for each company cohort
- **Key Constraints**: One trade per company per cohort month
- **Business Logic**: Defines revenue sharing terms

#### **Payments Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    customer_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    payment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    cohort_month DATE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (amount >= 0),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- **Purpose**: Customer payment records from portfolio companies
- **Key Features**: 
  - Tracks individual customer payments
  - Links payments to cohorts for analysis
  - Amount validation

#### **Spends Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE spends (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cohort_month DATE NOT NULL,
    spend NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (spend >= 0),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(company_id, cohort_month)
);
```
- **Purpose**: Marketing/acquisition spend by company and cohort
- **Key Constraints**: One spend record per company per cohort month

#### **Thresholds Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE thresholds (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INTEGER REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    payment_period_month INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (payment_period_month >= 0),
    minimum_payment_percent NUMERIC NOT NULL CHECK (minimum_payment_percent BETWEEN 0 AND 1),
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- **Purpose**: Performance benchmarks for payment collections
- **Business Logic**: Defines minimum payment thresholds by period

#### **Customers Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    cohort_month DATE NOT NULL,
    spend_id INTEGER REFERENCES spends(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
- **Purpose**: Customer records linked to acquisition spends
- **Relationship**: Many customers per spend record

### Database Operations Layer

#### **Repository Pattern Implementation**
The codebase implements a repository pattern through `DatabaseOperations`:

```python
class DatabaseOperations:
    def __init__(self, db: Session):
        self.companies = CompanyOperations(db)
        self.trades = TradeOperations(db)
        self.payments = PaymentOperations(db)
        self.spends = SpendOperations(db)
        self.thresholds = ThresholdOperations(db)
```

#### **Migration Strategy**
- **Alembic**: Manages database schema versions
- **Migration Files**: Located in `/alembic/versions/`
- **Key Migrations**:
  - Initial schema creation
  - Table renames (cohorts → trades)
  - Precision improvements (Float → Numeric)
  - New table additions (spends, customers)

### Data Integrity

#### **Foreign Key Constraints**
- All child tables reference companies with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- Ensures data consistency when companies are removed

#### **Check Constraints**
- Positive amounts for payments and spends
- Valid percentage ranges for thresholds and sharing rates

#### **Unique Constraints**
- Company names must be unique
- One trade/spend per company per cohort month

## Calculations & Business Logic

### Core Financial Calculation Engine: Deep Dive into calc.py

The `calc.py` file serves as the heart of the CVF portfolio management system, implementing sophisticated financial modeling for venture capital fund analysis. The calculations center around cohort-based analytics, churn predictions, and complex revenue sharing algorithms.

#### **Primary Function: `compute_company_cohort_cashflows`**

This is the main orchestrator function that processes all financial data for a company and returns structured cohort analysis:

```python
def compute_company_cohort_cashflows(
    company_id: str, 
    trades: List[Trade], 
    payments: List[Payment], 
    spends: List[Spend], 
    thresholds: List[Threshold], 
    churn: Optional[float] = None
) -> List[FundedCohort | Cohort]
```

**Function Architecture**:
1. **Data Consolidation**: Creates a unified view of all financial data by cohort month
2. **Period Processing**: Iterates through payment periods with actual and predicted data
3. **Revenue Sharing**: Applies complex business rules for fund collections
4. **IRR Calculation**: Computes investment returns for funded cohorts

#### **Data Consolidation Logic**

The function begins by creating a `ConsolidatedCohort` dataclass that unifies all related financial data:

```python
@dataclass
class ConsolidatedCohort:
    spend: Spend              # Marketing investment data
    trade: Optional[Trade]    # Revenue sharing terms (if funded)
    payments: List[Payment]   # Customer payment history
```

**Consolidation Process**:
- Groups all spends by cohort month as the foundation
- Associates trades (funding terms) with their respective cohorts
- Aggregates all payments by cohort month for analysis

This approach ensures that each cohort has a complete financial picture before processing begins.

#### **Payment Aggregation by Month**

The `_aggregate_payments_by_month` helper function creates a time-series structure:

```python
def _aggregate_payments_by_month(payments: List[Payment]) -> Dict:
    payments_by_month = defaultdict(list)
    for p in payments:
        month_key = p.payment_date.replace(day=1)  # Normalize to month start
        payments_by_month[month_key].append(p)
    return payments_by_month
```

**Purpose**: Transforms individual payment records into monthly aggregations for period-based analysis, essential for cohort retention analysis and churn modeling.

#### **Period Processing Engine**

The core calculation loop processes each payment period with sophisticated logic:

##### **Period Length Determination**
```python
num_periods_base = len(payments_by_month)
num_periods = max(num_periods_base, PREDICTION_LENGTH_MONTHS) if churn is not None and ch.trade else num_periods_base
```

**Logic**:
- **Actual Data Only**: Uses historical payment periods when no churn provided
- **Predictive Modeling**: Extends to 36 months when churn modeling is enabled for funded cohorts
- **Business Rationale**: Investors need long-term projections to evaluate fund performance

##### **Actual vs Predicted Period Detection**
```python
def _is_predicted_period(period_num: int, payments_by_month: Dict, churn: Optional[float]) -> bool:
    return False if churn is None else period_num >= len(payments_by_month)-1
```

**Decision Logic**: Periods beyond historical data become predicted when churn modeling is enabled.

##### **Payment Amount Calculation**

For each period, the system calculates payment amounts using different methods:

**Actual Periods** (Historical Data):
```python
payment_period_month = list(payments_by_month.keys())[period_num]
payments = payments_by_month[payment_period_month]
payment_sum = sum([p.amount for p in payments])
```

**Predicted Periods** (Churn-Based Forecasting):
```python
payment_period_month = latest_period_month + relativedelta(months = 1)
payment_sum = _compute_prediction_for_period(periods, churn)
```

The prediction algorithm implements exponential decay:
```python
def _compute_prediction_for_period(periods: List[FundedPeriod | PredictedFundedPeriod], churn: float) -> Decimal:
    return Decimal(periods[-1].payment * (1-churn))
```

**Mathematical Model**: `future_payment = last_payment × (1 - churn_rate)`

This creates a geometric decay series that models customer attrition over time.

This method of calculating churn is very simplistic, we might want to look at a better way of calculating the correct m0 and churn values. Right now, we just look at the last value to determine m0, we could use the average or the 75% median, so we're not thrown off by an abnormally high last payment. For churn, we can do this by doing the some of monthly churns / number of months.

#### **Revenue Sharing Algorithm**

For funded cohorts (those with trades), the system implements complex revenue sharing rules:

##### **Threshold Analysis**
```python
payment_percentage = payment_sum / ch.spend.spend
threshold = thresholds_by_period_num.get(period_num, None)
threshold_failed = threshold is not None and payment_percentage < threshold.minimum_payment_percent
```

**Business Logic**: If the payment-to-spend ratio falls below the defined threshold, the fund applies penalty terms.

##### **Share Calculation**
```python
share_applied = 1 if threshold_failed else ch.trade.sharing_percentage
collected = min(share_applied * payment_sum, ch.trade.cash_cap - cumulative_collected)
```

**Algorithm Components**:
1. **Threshold Override**: 100% collection (share_applied = 1) when performance is below threshold. This is another area where we can make it modifiable by enabling overrides by the admin team. Right now, we default to collecting 100%, but we can also choose to set our collection percentage to be a lower amount.
2. **Normal Sharing**: Apply the negotiated sharing percentage for meeting targets
3. **Cash Cap Enforcement**: Respect the maximum collection limit across all periods

##### **Cash Cap Management**
```python
cumulative_collected += collected
period_capped = collected == ch.trade.cash_cap
capped = True if period_capped else capped

# Early termination for predicted periods
if _is_predicted_period(period_num, payments_by_month, churn) and capped:
    break
```

**Optimization**: Stops processing predicted periods once the cash cap is reached, improving performance for long-term projections.

#### **IRR (Internal Rate of Return) Calculation**

The system calculates investment returns using industry-standard IRR methodology:

```python
def _calculate_funded_cohort_irr(spend: float, periods: List[FundedPeriod | PredictedFundedPeriod]) -> Optional[float]:
    cash_flows = [-spend]  # Initial investment (negative cash flow)
    cash_flows += [p.payment for p in periods]  # Collection cash flows
    monthly_irr = npf.irr(cash_flows)
    annual_irr = (1 + monthly_irr) ** 12 - 1  # Convert to annualized rate
    return annual_irr
```

**Financial Mathematics**:
- Uses numpy-financial's IRR function for accurate calculation
- Converts monthly IRR to annualized equivalent using compound growth formula
- Models the fund's investment (-spend) and returns (+collections) over time

#### **Dual Cohort Model Creation**

The function creates different cohort types based on funding status:

##### **Funded Cohorts** (With Trades)
```python
FundedCohort(
    cohort_month=cohort_month,
    company_id=company_id,
    spend=ch.spend.spend,
    periods=periods,  # List[FundedPeriod | PredictedFundedPeriod]
    customers=customers,
    cumulative_payment=cumulative_payment,
    trade_id=ch.trade.id,
    sharing_percentage=ch.trade.sharing_percentage,
    cash_cap=ch.trade.cash_cap,
    cumulative_collected=cumulative_collected,
    capped=capped,
    annual_irr=annual_irr
)
```

##### **Unfunded Cohorts** (No Trades)
```python
Cohort(
    cohort_month=cohort_month,
    company_id=company_id,
    spend=ch.spend.spend,
    periods=periods,  # List[Period]
    customers=customers,
    cumulative_payment=cumulative_payment,
)
```

**Design Rationale**: Separate models allow for different analytics and reporting based on funding status, while maintaining type safety.

#### **Period-Level Data Structures**

The system creates detailed period records with different types based on context:

##### **Base Period** (Unfunded Cohorts)
```python
Period(
    period=period_num,
    month=payment_period_month,
    payment=payment_sum,
    cumulative_payment=cumulative_payment,
)
```

##### **Funded Period** (Actual Data)
```python
FundedPeriod(
    period=period_num,
    month=payment_period_month,
    payment=payment_sum,
    cumulative_payment=cumulative_payment,
    threshold_payment_percentage=threshold_payment_percentage,
    threshold_expected_payment=threshold_expected_payment,
    threshold_failed=threshold_failed,
    share_applied=share_applied,
    collected=collected,
    cumulative_collected=cumulative_collected,
    capped=period_capped,
)
```

##### **Predicted Funded Period** (Forecasted Data)
```python
PredictedFundedPeriod(
    # Inherits all FundedPeriod fields
    predicted=True  # Distinguishes predicted from actual data
)
```

**Business Value**: These metrics help evaluate the effectiveness of marketing spend and predict future profitability.

#### **Design Patterns and Architecture**

##### **Functional Decomposition**
The code follows clear functional decomposition with helper functions for specific calculations:
- `_aggregate_payments_by_month`: Time-series aggregation
- `_calculate_funded_cohort_irr`: Financial calculations
- `_is_predicted_period`: Business logic for data classification
- `_compute_prediction_for_period`: Churn modeling

##### **Type Safety and Validation**
- Comprehensive type hints using `Union` types for period variations
- Pydantic model integration for API validation
- Decimal precision for financial calculations to avoid floating-point errors

##### **Performance Considerations**
- Early termination when cash caps are reached
- Efficient dictionary lookups for thresholds
- Minimal object creation in calculation loops

#### **Business Model Implementation**

The calculation engine implements a sophisticated venture capital funding model:

1. **Customer Value Fund Concept**: The fund provides marketing capital to companies in exchange for a percentage of future customer payments
2. **Performance-Based Terms**: Threshold mechanisms ensure companies meet performance targets
3. **Risk Management**: Cash caps limit the fund's exposure per investment
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Churn modeling enables scenario planning and risk assessment

This calculation framework provides the foundation for portfolio-level analytics, enabling fund managers to evaluate performance, optimize allocation strategies, and make data-driven investment decisions.

### Data Models & Response Types

#### **Cohort Representation**
```python
class Cohort(BaseModel):
    cohort_month: date
    company_id: int
    spend: float
    periods: List[Period]
    customers: List[str]
    cumulative_payment: float
    funded: bool = False

class FundedCohort(Cohort):
    trade_id: int
    sharing_percentage: float
    cash_cap: float
    cumulative_collected: float
    periods: List[FundedPeriod | PredictedFundedPeriod]
    capped: bool
    annual_irr: float
    funded: bool = True
```

#### **Period-Level Details**
```python
class Period(BaseModel):
    period: int
    month: date
    payment: float
    cumulative_payment: float

class FundedPeriod(Period):
    threshold_payment_percentage: Optional[float]
    threshold_expected_payment: Optional[float]
    threshold_failed: bool
    share_applied: float
    collected: float
    cumulative_collected: float
    capped: bool

class PredictedFundedPeriod(FundedPeriod):
    predicted: bool = True
```

### Analytics Calculations

#### **Cashflow Projection**
The system supports two cashflow endpoints:
1. **Current Cashflows**: Based on actual payment data
2. **Predicted Cashflows**: Incorporates churn-based forecasting

**Input for Predictions**:
```python
class CashflowRequest(BaseModel):
    churn: float  # Monthly churn rate for predictions
```

## Future Investment Areas

### 1. **Scalability & Performance**

#### **Database Optimization**
- **Current State**: SQLite for development
- **Investment Needed**:
  - PostgreSQL migration for production
  - Database indexing optimization
  - Query performance monitoring
  - Connection pooling implementation
  - Improved security
  - Sharding when data gets really large

#### **Caching Strategy**
- **Problem**: Expensive cohort calculations on every request
- **Solutions**:
  - Redis caching for calculated cashflows
  - Background job processing for large calculations
  - Incremental calculation updates
  - Simplest idea is to have a cache for all API endpoints, and as soon as a mutating operation (update spends or update payments) happens, we invalidate the cohort's key in the cache. Then, we can kick off an async operation to recompute cashflows, which will be dumped into the cache.

#### **API Performance**
- **Current Limitations**: Synchronous processing
- **Improvements**:
  - Pagination for large datasets. We have a very small set of data that we're currently processing that is primarily seeded by a seed_data.py script. As more and more data becomes available, we will need to modify our API to properly handle response sizes that are far larger than what we currently support.

### 2. **Advanced Analytics & ML**

#### **Predictive Modeling**
- **Current**: Simple churn-based projections
- **Enhancement Opportunities**:
  - Machine learning models for churn prediction. Our way of calculating churn and m0 at the moment is very basic. This is an area where we can invest a lot into to run regressions etc to better predict cohort performance.
  - Temporary adjustment algorithms. Right now, churn is modifiable by the CVF admin, but we can make this something where we can guide the CVF admin based on historical performance as to what would be appropriate churn values based on outputs.

#### **Real-time Analytics**
- **Investment Areas**:
  - Alert systems for threshold breaches. Another potential area of investment here is calculating whether we will project to pass a threshold midway through the month. We probably have enough historical data to build some simple mathematical model that can help us predict the outcome over a range of 3-4 days as opposed to a whole month.
  - Automated reporting to us as CVF admins and the portfolio companies.

#### **Advanced Financial Metrics**
- **Additional Calculations**:
  - Better IRR calculations for us as investors. How are cohorts are stacking up against past cohorts. Projected IRRs based on historical performance.
  - Whether certain customers churn at a higher rate for portfolio companies.
  - Could do some really interesting simulations with random sampling of data to see how cohorts perform.

### 3. **Data Integration & ETL**

#### **Data Pipeline Architecture**
- **Current**: Manual CSV uploads
- **Future State**:
  - Automated data ingestion from company systems
  - API integrations with payment processors
  - Data validation and cleansing pipelines
  
#### **Data Quality & Governance**
- **Investment Needs**:
  - Data validation and cleaning. This will be a huge area of focus because gettting data in to the system efficiently and correctly is probably the greatest determinant of success to the system.

### 4. **User Interface & Experience**

#### **Frontend Development**
- **Current State**: API-only (Swagger docs)
- **Investment Opportunities**:
  - Cooler dashboards, better metrics, aggregated bar graphs.

### 5. **Security & Compliance**

#### **Authentication & Authorization**
- **Current Gap**: No authentication system

#### **Data Security**
- **Investment Areas**:
  - Ecyrption
  - Audit logging

## Developer tooling

### Claude code
I used a multi-agent setup with Claude Code that dramatically sped up my iteration speed.
It consisted of the following agents:
- Database migration agent (handled all DB changes)
- API endpoint manager (all API changes)
- Code reviewer (periodically assessed for type correctness)
- Documentation writer (wrote all markdown files)

### Lovable
I used Lovable extensively to mock up the UI initially. I found it had certain strengths and weaknesses compared to Claude Code, which I'm happy to discuss my views on further.
